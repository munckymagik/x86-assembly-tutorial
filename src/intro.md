# Basic x86 Assembly Language Tutorial

> TODO write an introduction and motivation.

## Intro notes

* Will use Gnu AS (GAS) "like" assembler. The LLVM assembler on Mac OS X can be used as it has the same interface, similarly the MinGW assembler on Windows as I believe it is derived from GAS.
* We will use AT&T syntax rather than Intel, as this is the format compilers and disassemblers seem to output by default according to my limited experience so far.
